This took me more than an hour for something so "simple"
In qrcode.png's metadata we can see in the comments that the flag has been removed for security reasons.
After applying different stenography techniques, I had the brilliant idea to check the github commits....
And indeed there was an old qrcode.png WITH the flag in the metadata.... very nice :)

(probably the creator's idea was to get something anti-AI solvable)
